Description:
    MultimodalExperiment is an S4 class that integrates bulk and single-cell
    experiment data; it is optimally storage-efficient, and its methods are
    exceptionally fast. It effortlessly represents multimodal data of any nature
    and features normalized experiment, subject, sample, and cell annotations,
    which are related to underlying biological experiments through maps. Its
    coordination methods are opt-in and employ database-like join operations
    internally to deliver fast and flexible management of multimodal data.
